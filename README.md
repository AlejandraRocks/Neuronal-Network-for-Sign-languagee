I worked with a portion of the SIGNS dataset created by deeplearning.ai for one of its specializations. The dataset consisted of photos of hands making the corresponding sign for a number between zero and five in international sign language.

The objective was to train an algorithm to identify, from a given photo, which number it represented.

I trained a Fully Conected Neuronal network and a Convolutional Neuronal Network for solve this problem:
