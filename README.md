# Neuronal-Network-for-Sign-languagee

I worked with a portion of the SIGNS dataset created by deeplearning.ai for one of its specializations. The dataset consisted of photos of hands making the corresponding sign for a number between zero and five in international sign language.

The objective was to train an algorithm to identify, from a given photo, which number it represented.
